**Benchmarking Micro-action Recognition: Dataset, Method, and Application**

This paper is currently under review and we will update it as soon as possible.

## Introduction
Micro-action constitutes an indiscernible form of nonverbal behavior characterized by low movement intensity, offering a wide range of insights into individuals' feelings and intentions. Notably, this form of behavior is pivotal for human-oriented applications ranging from emotion recognition to psychological assessment. In this work, we construct a novel dataset designated Micro-action-58 (MA-58). This dataset encompasses a comprehensive array of realistic and natural micro-actions, accounting for 205 participants and 25,034 video instances collated from the psychological interviews. In contrast to existing datasets that concentrate predominantly on gestures and upper limb movements, MA-58 provides a unique whole-body perspective. Specifically, MA-58 includes 58 micro-action categories along with eight body part labels. The dataset enabled the acquisition of rich leg and foot movements, such as leg crossing and foot stretching, captured from participants in seated postures.
